# Belief Revision Agent â€“ DTU 02180 Intro to AI

This repository implements a belief revision agent based on AGM theory using propositional logic. The agent supports expansion, contraction, and entailment operations over a belief base and is designed to demonstrate rational belief change in accordance with the AGM postulates.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

- **Belief Base**: Stores propositional formulas, each with an integer priority. Higher priority beliefs are preserved when contractions are required.
- **Entailment**: Resolution-based checker for logical entailment (implemented from scratch).
- **Contraction**: Implements partial meet contraction using a priority-based selection function.
- **Expansion**: Adds new formulas to the base (possibly introducing inconsistency).
- **Revision**: Implements the Levi identity: contraction followed by expansion.

This implementation is intended as part of the Belief Revision assignment for the DTU course *02180 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence* (Spring 2025).

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### Belief Representation

Each belief is a pair: `(<Formula>, priority)`  
Formulas are automatically converted to **CNF** for resolution-based reasoning.

### Entailment

The function `resolution_entails(kb, Ï†)` checks whether a belief base entails a query using the resolution principle:
- If the empty clause âŠ¥ is derived from `B âˆª {Â¬Ï†}`, then `B âŠ¨ Ï†`.

### Contraction

Partial meet contraction:
- Finds all maximal subsets of `B` that do not entail `Ï†`.
- Selects the ones with highest total priority.
- Contracts to the intersection of selected remainders.

### Expansion

Adds a formula `Ï†` with a priority. Follows:

B + Ï† = B âˆª {Ï†}

Does not ensure consistency.

### Revision

Defined by the Levi Identity:

B * Ï† = (B - Â¬Ï†) + Ï†

## ðŸ§ª Running the Code

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- No external libraries required.

### Running the Tests
Make sure that you are in the root directory.
Run the AGM postulate tests via:
```bash
python -m Tests.test_AGM_postulates
```
### Example
Insert the formulas on `test_parser.txt`
Run the agent with input formulas:
```bash
python -m Agent.agent
